			<h4>
				Hello and welcome to Washington Wellness for your health and fitness needs. The fitness industry is forever progressing and I believe the client or consumer has to be pointed in the right direction to help progress their health goals. This site is designed to help you embark upon your daily physical activity and at the same time maintain a healthy food regime that will be the most beneficial for you.
				<br><br>
				Human beings have an idea of becoming physically active, but the use of social media can be a little intimidating to you the "consumer". Here at Washington Wellness I will strive to push you in the right direction to improve your health physically, mentally, and emotionally. These components affect your daily activities. Science has proven that meeting fitness goals helps improve daily cognitive function and prevents the breakdown of muscle tissue. I strive to make your body a better functional machine.
				<br><br>
				In closing, you may be asking how do I do this?  I follow a simple rule "listen to what the customer needs". Once I understand what you, the client, is expecting out of me as your trainer and strength and conditioning coach, I write up an individualized workout program based on a four to six week progression phase to help you progress towards those fitness goals. Every client has a different program base and all exercises are built and progressed from the the last series of workouts. We're on this journey together and I'm here to help you in any way I possibly can.
