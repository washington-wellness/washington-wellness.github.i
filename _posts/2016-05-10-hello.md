Im a former two time All American in the 110 meter high hurdles and retired pro track athlete. Ive been a certified trainer since Sept 2003. When it comes to program design Ive done it all but yoga and pilates.I have a background in performance enhancement. Have worked with high school, college and NFL Athletes.

I evolve program design as long as the client progresses through their workout regime. I have worked with overweight people changed many lives in my career, got people who's human mechanics were all off and got the right program to get them up going and progressing in life!

When you come to train with me expect me to be very personable, funny, serious when I need to be, Im middle of the road personality wise and will tailor your workouts to your exact needs. You can reach me through email or phone number. Im also here to network with other trainers because the industry is forever evolving.
