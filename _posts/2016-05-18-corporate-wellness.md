One of the main reasons physical activity creates a better work environment is due to the increase of circulation in the body and serotonin levels are also raised which helps the average person in their day to day function. A [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinharrington/2015/05/13/corporate-wellness-health-wellness-and-an-improved-bottom-line/#14209a827686) presented the scientific research that healthier employees are more likely to be productive because of such factors as:

<strong>Healthy employees have greater energy levels and higher self-esteem</strong>

<strong>Healthy employees take less sick days, have lower absenteeism, and have reduced health care costs</strong>

In short, healthy employees donâ€™t suck. All of this translates to more corporate productivity, which in turn is translated to more corporate profitability. Can I get an Amen?
