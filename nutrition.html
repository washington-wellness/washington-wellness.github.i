									Workout programs that are designed for weight loss will follow a "low glycemic" high protein based food regime. Low glycemic foods have a better effect on the body for overall daily health.<br><br> A low glycemic food regime is one that selects alteration of circulating glucose levels. Glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) are measures of the effect on blood glucose level after a food containing carbohydrates is consumed. Glucose is one of the body's main sources of energy.<br><br> When you consume carbohydrates your liver breaks down the carb into glucose. Glucose is used to fuel the brain, muscles, and other internal organs, hence giving you sustained energy throughout the day versus consuming a high GI food and "crashing" hard. <br><br>A glucose level is set at 100,  and all foods are indexed against that number ranging from 0 to 100. Low GI foods affect blood glucose and insulin levels less and have a slower rate of digestion and absorption.
